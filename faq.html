                            <p>Here you'll find some frequently asked questions about our hotel.
                                We hope that you find it interesting and informative. These are the questions

                            <p class="question">What is the story behind the hotel's theme?</p>
                            <p class="answer">This hotel theme was inspired by my study abroad trip to Paris when I was 22. I loved the cafes, shops, and food. All of the images on this website were taken by me.</p>
                            <p class="question">What are the check-in and check-out times?</p>
                            <p class="answer">Check-out time is 11am and check-in is between 1 and 5pm. Speak to the front desk staff if you have special circumstances.</p>
                            <p class="question">In addition to your accommodations, what other services do you offer?</p>
                            <p class="answer">The Hôtel des Bisous is the perfect place for a romantic getaway, a fully
                                catered business meeting, or an event as special as a wedding. We do offer great room
                                service food as well as a full service spa, both of which help our guests feel like they've
                                come to the right place to get away from it all. </p>
                            <p class="question">Do you have a pool?</p>
                            <p class="answer">Like all hotels we too have a pool, but ours is actually quite unique. You'll just have to see it to believe it.</p>
                            <p class="question">Do you accept AAA discounts, or other discount cards?</p>
                            <p class="answer">No we don't accept any discount cards, but that doesn't mean
                                we don't have discount prices on our rooms. We do offer different kinds
                                of specials, some seasonal, some for senior, just for returning guests, etc. Visit
                                the events page on this Web site to see if any special discounts are currently
                                in effect, or just call our reservations desk.</p>
